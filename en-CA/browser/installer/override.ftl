### Strings used by the Windows installer. They are converted to NSIS
### language files at build time, so only plain text and the variables
### documented below are supported.
### Advanced Fluent features such as plurals, select expressions, and
### term/message references are not supported.
###
### Some strings end with a space, written as { " " } at the end of the
### string. Keep it in the translation.


## Variables:
##   $BrandFullName (String) - The full brand name (e.g. Mozilla Firefox).
